### 🚀 Quick Summary

MS Computer Science student focusing on autonomous vehicle systems, AI/ML, and software engineering. I combine academic research and industry experience to build practical solutions from full-stack vehicle control systems to enterprise data analytics.

---

### 🔑 Highlights

- Lead experience: Directing a 15+ student team on the EcoCAR CAV project (ADAS, sensor fusion, V2X).
- AI & Autonomy: Model Predictive Control, Reinforcement Learning, Gaussian Processes, and sensor fusion research & implementations.
- Production & Analytics: Built enterprise dashboards and ETL using Power BI, Tableau, Azure, and Generative AI for productivity features.
- Full-stack engineering: Comfortable across embedded systems (NXP, RTMaps, Simulink), Python & C++ stacks, mobile (Flutter), and cloud environments.
